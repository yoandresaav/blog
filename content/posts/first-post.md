This is my first Hello World! using [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/).

> Hello world Hugo!

My idea behind this blog,  is learn about fast html sites generators like [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) and the technologies involved. 

Hugo is developed using [**GO**](https://go.dev/) and inherit his speeds.

I choose Hugo because it is a fast and simple to use. It use markdown for create content.
