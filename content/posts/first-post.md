This is my first Hello World! using [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/).

> Hello world Hugo!

My idea behind this blog,  is learn about fast html sites generators like [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) and the technologies involved. 

Hugo is developed using [**GO**](https://go.dev/) and inherit his speeds.

I choose Hugo because it is a fast and simple to use. It use markdown for create content.

### Why Hugo?

Why no? When I start in the world of software development, I want to developer all from scratch. For example, I wanted to create a programing language, my own operating system, my own crypto and my own IA asistent. All from scratch. I desired learn the fundamentals of techologies.

Many years after that I start to thing in why I write code. And my reason is that I want help the humanity to improvement his lives, also get some money in the way.

My conclusion is that I need to try to figura out how to deliver products faster and for a low cost for the clients.

### So and this blog?

This is for document my progress in this mission. Is an effort to become a better human and programmer.

Thanks.
